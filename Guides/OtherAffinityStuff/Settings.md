# Settings

Affinity apps sometimes tend to not save settings properly. There's 2 ways of fixing this.

# Method A

Clone this repository and then put the files inside `AffinityOnLinux/Guides/OtherAffinityStuff/Settings/APPNAME/VERSION/Settings/` to their respective folders.

# Method B

Get your settings from a windows machine and then paste them to the right directory inside the `wineprefix`.

`C:\users\$USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Affinity\`

# Editing the settings

You can edit the settings via a text editor.
