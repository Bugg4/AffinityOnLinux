### Information

> [!WARNING]
> Be advised that, if you purchased the old **1.X version** of the Affinity applications through the [**Windows Store**](https://apps.microsoft.com/), you will **not** be able to activate your old licence on another operating systems other than Windows.  
> The Windows Store does not provide the product key you will need to enter after the installation, so, if you want to stay on Linux and don't want to buy a V2 licence (since V1 isn't sold anymore), your only option is to use a Windows virtual machine, sign into your Microsoft account on the Windows Store, and download your V1 apps from there.
